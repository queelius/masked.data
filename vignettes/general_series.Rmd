Introduction
============

The R package `series.system.estimation.masked.data` is a framework for
estimating the parameters of latent component lifetimes from *masked data*
in a series system.

# Masked data

Masked data is given by an i.i.d. sample of system lifetime data and
*plausible* candidate sets that contain the failed node.

# Statistical model for masked data

The principle object of study is the series system consisting of $m$
components. We are interested in estimating the component lifetimes from
masked data in the form of candidate sets, where the candidate sets
satisfy the following set of conditions:
    
- Condition $C_1$: The index of the failed component is in the candidate set,
  i.e., $\Pr\{K_i \in C_i\} = 1$.

- Condition $C_2$: The probability of $C_i$ given $K_i$ and $T_i$ is equally
  probable when the failed component varies over the components in the candidate
  set, i.e., $\Pr\{C_i=c_i|K_i=j,T_i=t_i\} = \Pr\{C_i=c_i|K_i=j',T_i=t_i\}$ for
  any $j,j' \in c_i$.
    
- Condition $C_3$: The masking probabilities are independent of $\v\theta$,
  i.e., $\Pr\{C_i=c_i|K_i=j,T_i=t_i\}$ is not a function of $\v\theta$.
  
  That means, whatever the generative mechanism underlying
  $\mathcal{C}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{C}_n$, it has no explicit knowledge of $\v\theta$,
  but the $i$\textsuperscript{th} candidate set $\mathcal{C}_i$ may depend on
  the realizations of $T_{i 1},\ldots,T_{i n}$ and other factors not explicitly
  in the statistical model we have described.

General series system
=====================

In the general series system, we no longer restrict ourselves to the case where
each component lifetime comes from the same parametric family, like Weibull
or exponential.
This adds a slightly bit more sophistication to the setup, but we already have
the general form of the likelihood function that only makes reference to the
reliability and hazard functions of individual component lifetimes.

We consider a general series system of $m=3$ components.
Components $1$ and $2$ have lifetimes in the Weibull family and component $3$
has a lifetime in the exponential family.

Let's simulate a series system with masked data with a right-censoring time of
$\tau_i = 3$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$ and with an Bernoulli candidate model
appropriate set of parameters to satisfy conditions $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$,
where $\gamma = 0.25$ is the probability that each non-failed component is in
the candidate set. Here is the R code to simulate the data:
```{r}
n <- 500
m <- 3
exp.lam <- log(2)/2
wei1.shape <- 100
wei1.scale <- 2/(log(2)^(1/wei1.shape))

wei2.shape <- 200
wei2.scale <- 2/(log(2)^(1/wei2.shape))

theta <- c(wei1.shape,wei1.scale,
           wei2.shape,wei2.scale,
           exp.lam)
print(theta)
tau <- 1.975
md <- tibble(t1=rweibull(n,theta[1],theta[2]),
             t2=rweibull(n,theta[3],theta[4]),
             t3=rexp(n,theta[5])) %>%
    md_series_lifetime() %>%
    md_series_lifetime_right_censoring(tau=tau) %>%
    md_bernoulli_candidate_C1_C2_C3(m, function(n) rep(.25,n))
print(md)
```

## Log-likelihood of $\theta$ given masked data

The reduced log-likelihood function (the log of the kernel of the likelihood
function) is given by
$$
\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{l=1}^m \log R_j(t_i) + \sum_{i=1}^n \log \Bigl\{ \sum_{j \in c_i} h_j(t_i) \Bigr\}.
$$

The following log-likelihood constructor, `md_loglike_general_series_C1_C2_c3`,
implements the log-likelihood $\ell$ in a straightforward way, e.g., no
minimally sufficient set of statistics are derived and it accepts four arguments:

1. The maked data `md`.
2. A vector specifying the number of parameters for each component.
3. A list of the reliability functions for the components.
4. A list of the hazard functions for the components.

We compute the log-likelihood function with:
```{r}
nparams <- c(2,2,1)
hs <- list()
Rs <- list()
hs[[1]] <- function(t,theta) theta[2]/theta[1]*(t/theta[1])^(theta[2]-1)
Rs[[1]] <- function(t,theta) exp((-t/theta[1])^theta[2])

hs[[2]] <- function(t,theta) theta[2]/theta[1]*(t/theta[1])^(theta[2]-1)
Rs[[2]] <- function(t,theta) exp((-t/theta[1])^theta[2])

hs[[3]] <- function(t,rate) rate
Rs[[3]] <- function(t,rate) exp(-t*rate)

print(hs[[1]](2,theta[1:2]))
print(hs[[2]](2,theta[3:4]))
print(hs[[3]](2,theta[5]))

print(Rs[[1]](2,theta[1:2]))
print(Rs[[2]](2,theta[3:4]))
print(Rs[[3]](2,theta[5]))

knitr::knit_exit()
```


```{r}
loglike.general <- md_loglike_general_series_C1_C2_C3(md,nparams,hs,Rs)
print(loglike.general)
print(loglike.general(theta))
knitr::knit_exit()
```

The log-likelihood function contains the maximum amount of information
about parameter $\v\theta$ given the sample of masked data `md` satisfying
conditions $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$.

With the log-likelihood, we may estimate $\theta$ with $\hat\theta$ by solving
$$
\hat{\v\theta} = \operatorname{argmax}_{\v\theta \in \Omega} \ell(\theta),
$$
i.e., finding the point that *maximizes* the log-likelihood on
the observed sample `md`.
This is known as *maximum likelihood estimation* (MLE).
We typically solve for the MLE by solving
$$
\nabla \ell|_{\v\theta=\hat{\v\theta}} = \v{0}.
$$
We use the iterative method known as the Newton-Raphson to solve this, which
has the updating equation
$$
\v\theta^{(n+1)} = \v\theta^n + \alpha_n \nabla \ell(\v\theta^n),
$$
where $\alpha_n$ is chosen to approximately maximize $\ell(\theta^{(n+1))}$ by
using backtracking line search.

We use the function `mle_newton_raphson` provided by the R package `algebraic.mle`
with the appropriate arguments.
We find $\hat{\v\theta}$ by running the following R code:
```{r}
mle <- mle_newton_raphson(l=loglike.general,theta0=theta)
```

The function `md_newton_raphson` returns an `mle` object, which
has various methods implemented for it, e.g., `confint` (computes the
estimator's confidence interval).
We use the `summary` method, which takes an `mle` object and prints out a
summary of its statistics:
```{r}
summary(mle)
```

We let $\hat{\v\theta}$ be given by the `point` method:
```{r}
point(mle)
```
We see that $\hat{\v\theta} = (`r theta.hat`)$.
