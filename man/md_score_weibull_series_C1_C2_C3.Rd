\title{Score function generator (gradient of the log-likelihood) for Weibull series
system on masked data, where the masked data is in the form of right-censored
system lifetimes and masked component cause of failure. Note that if the
right censoring indicator variable \code{delta} is missing, we assume that all
system lifetimes are observed.}
\usage{
md_score_weibull_series_C1_C2_C3(
  md,
  sysvar = "t",
  setvar = "x",
  deltavar = "delta"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{md}{masked data}

\item{sysvar}{name of the system lifetime column}

\item{setvar}{prefix symbol for the candidate sets column}

\item{deltavar}{right-censoring indicator column name, if TRUE, then the
system lifetime is right-censored (\emph{not} observed),
otherwise it is observed (\emph{not} right-censored).}
}
\value{
a score function with respect to theta given md
}
\description{
Masked component data \code{md} approximately satisfies the following conditions:
C1: Pr(K in C) = 1
C2: Pr(C=c | K=j, T=t) = Pr(C=c | K=j', T=t)
for any j, j' in c.
C3: masking probabilities are independent of theta
